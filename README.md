# WeatherApplication

Welcome to the **WeatherApplication** project! This project demonstrates advanced techniques using Dagger Hilt for dependency injection in an Android application that follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture.

## Project Overview

In this project, we leverage Dagger Hilt to manage dependencies in a clean and efficient manner, simplifying the process of integrating different components. The MVVM architecture helps in separating the UI code from the business logic, making the app more maintainable and testable.

### Key Features

- **Dagger Hilt Integration:** Simplifies dependency injection with annotations and auto-generated code.
- **MVVM Architecture:** Clear separation of concerns between the UI and business logic.
- **LiveData and ViewModel:** Utilizes LiveData for reactive UI updates and ViewModel for handling UI-related data lifecycle-consciously.
- **Coroutines:** Incorporates Kotlin Coroutines for asynchronous programming.
- **Weather API Integration:** Fetches weather data from an external API and displays it dynamically.
